  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/kentonv">Kenton Varda</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2014-07-11-demo-and-app-updates">11 Jul 2014</a>
  <p>A few quick updates today.</p>

<h3 id="new-demo-server">New Demo server</h3>

<p>It’s now possible to try out Sandstorm without an invite, and without installing
it locally. Just go to <a href="https://demo.sandstorm.io/demo">demo.sandstorm.io</a>.</p>

<p>On the demo server, anyone can create a one-hour trial account. We hope that
this will make it much easier for people to understand what Sandstorm does,
before they install it or wait in line for an invite. If a picture
is worth a thousand words, a demo is worth ten thousand.</p>

<h3 id="app-updates">App updates</h3>

<p>We’ve posted updates to several apps with bug fixes and other improvements.
Currently, in order to update an app, you must re-install it from the
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/apps">app list</a>. (Push updates for apps are on our
todo list.) So, if you’ve installed any of the following, install them again.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mailpile:</strong> Fixed bug where sent mail sometimes wasn’t saved.</li>
  <li><strong>IPython Notebook:</strong> Added numpy and plotting packages, so you can now plot graphs.</li>
  <li><strong>Etherpad:</strong> Minor UI tweaks.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-features-and-fixes">New features and fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We’ve added a “reset” button to the top bar, which lets you restart an app
if it somehow gets wedged. This is rare, but otherwise really annoying when
it happens.</li>
  <li>Apps now receive the user’s display name and a unique stable identifier,
which are useful for collaborative apps meant to be used by more than one
user.</li>
  <li>We fixed a crash that happened when updating a Sandstorm instance that runs
as non-root, and tightened some security knobs in this mode.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="license-is-now-apache-20">License is now Apache 2.0</h3>

<p>Several people told us they were not comfortable contributing to Sandstorm
when licensed under the GNU AGPL, or that their employers were hesitant to
allow them to contribute. We think this is entirely understandable. We have
always intended to switch to Apache 2.0 after gaining some momentum (which is
why we have asked contributors to sign a CLA allowing us to make this change).
So, we’ve gone ahead and made the switch now.</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2014-07-07-mailpile">Mailpile on Sandstorm</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/jparyani">Jason Paryani</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2014-07-07-mailpile">07 Jul 2014</a>
  <p>Hello, I’m Jason, a new member of the Sandstorm team. Today I’m excited to
announce that I’ve extended Sandstorm to support e-mail, and ported
<a href="https://www.mailpile.is/">Mailpile Alpha II</a> to demonstrate. Mailpile is
available on the <a href="https://sandstorm.io/apps/">Sandstorm app list</a> right now, so
go ahead and try it out.</p>

<p>You may know Mailpile from
<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mailpile-taking-e-mail-back">their successful Indiegogo campaign</a>
last year. They’ve been working hard to create a web mail app that is designed
to be self-hosted, which makes it a perfect fit for Sandstorm. It’s worth noting
that Mailpile itself is, like Sandstorm, still in alpha. It is still somewhat
rough around the edges, and may not quite be ready to replace your regular
e-mail client yet. We will be updating our port as Mailpile matures, and we’re
also looking at porting some other web mail apps so that you can choose the one
that’s right for you.</p>

<h3 id="how-sandstorm-does-e-mail">How Sandstorm does e-mail</h3>

<p>We know that switching people over to using Sandstorm for e-mail will take time.
So, we are starting with a design that makes it safe and easy to try out
Sandstorm without committing.</p>

<p>When you launch an e-mail application on Sandstorm, it is assigned a random
e-mail address at your server, like “JBuaKxjkwiJq7oksS@alpha.sandstorm.io”. Any
e-mail sent to that address is delivered to the app. The idea is not that you’d
actually use this address publicly, but rather that you should set up e-mail
forwarding from your real address to this address. For example, GMail allows
you to set up such forwarding while still keeping a copy in your GMail inbox,
and even lets you do the forwarding conditionally based on a filter.
Additionally, most domain registrars have the ability to set up basic e-mail
forwarding, so if you have your own domain, it’s easy to set up an address that
redirects to a Sandstorm app.</p>

<p>When you send e-mail from a Sandstorm app, we allow you to set the “From”
header either to your app’s random address or to your verified Sandstorm login
address. In the future, we’d like to add the ability to attach additional
verified addresses to your account. Either way, the message’s envelope return
address is always the app’s address. As a result, the mail recipient may see
that the message was sent “via” your server.</p>

<p>For more details on how to write an app that uses e-mail, and how to set up
your Sandstorm server to support e-mail, check out the docs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Configuring-your-server-for-email">Configuring your server for e-mail.</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Using-Email-From-Your-Sandstorm-App">Writing an app to use e-mail.</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-note-on-encryption">A note on encryption</h3>

<p>A key feature of Mailpile is its support for PGP / GPG encryption and
signatures. Unfortunately, this is not yet supported by our Sandstorm port, as
we need to do more work to get crypto right.</p>

<p>The simplest way we could support crypto would be to have you upload your
private key into the app, to be stored on the server. This is not a good idea!
In an ideal world, your private key would live only on a physical token or
smart card and never even touch the storage of a real computer. Barring that,
you should at least keep your key only on systems you own. If you run your own
Sandstorm server, then uploading your key might be OK, but for anyone using a
shared server, it’s not a good idea. We want a solution that works for everyone.</p>

<p>Therefore we are looking into how we can make crypto available to Sandstorm
apps without sending your key to the server. We are hopeful that the nascent
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/">WebCrypto API</a> might solve this problem,
but at present the standard is still under development and there is apparently
some controversy over its design. In the meantime, browser-extension-based
approaches like <a href="https://code.google.com/p/end-to-end/">Google’s End-To-End</a>
provide an intriguing alternative, although Chrome’s decision to kill off NPAPI
may make it impossible to access hardware tokens or your local GPG agent in
this way.</p>

<p>In any case, this is something we’ll be investigating further in the future.</p>

  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/kentonv">Kenton Varda</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2014-07-03-team-update">03 Jul 2014</a>
  <p>We have a bunch of updates for you today.</p>

<h3 id="lots-of-apps-coming">Lots of apps coming!</h3>

<p>We’ve ported a number of interesting apps to Sandstorm and will begin releasing
them within the next few days. First up will be
<a href="https://www.mailpile.is">Mailpile</a> – yes, e-mail in Sandstorm!
Expect a full announcement on Monday, and other app announcements over the
following days and weeks.</p>

<h3 id="team-updates">Team updates</h3>

<p>The Sandstorm team is no longer just me. I’d like to introduce all the new
faces that you now see on our front page:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jparyani"><strong>Jason Paryani</strong></a>, the author of Cap’n Proto’s
<a href="https://github.com/jparyani/pycapnp">Python port</a>, has been working
on features like backup/restore, e-mail, improved sharing/permissions, and
porting a number of exciting apps.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dwrensha"><strong>David Renshaw</strong></a>, the author of the
<a href="https://github.com/dwrensha/capnproto-rust">Rust</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/dwrensha/capnproto-java">Java</a> ports of Cap’n Proto, is
now joining the team as well. He’s written a couple games that you can find on
the app list (Duolodo and Acronymy) and is working on ports of
<a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/">ShareLaTeX</a> and other apps.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jadeqwang"><strong>Jade Wang</strong></a> has been working part-time on
developer outreach and operations. She organized our recent app hackathon
and other things you’ll be hearing about soon.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have a couple of key advisors. These guys are contributing advice, resouces,
and the occasional patch in their spare time; Sandstorm is not affiliated with
their respective employers.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/amluto"><strong>Andy Lutomirski</strong></a> is a Linux kernel developer
and has been helping us take better advantage of the kernel’s sandboxing features.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/swetland"><strong>Brian Swetland</strong></a> spent nine years as
Android’s Systems Engineering lead and has been advising us on platform design.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="backup--restore-functionality">Backup / Restore functionality</h3>

<p>Jason has implemented the ability to back up
and restore grains (app instances) from you Sandstorm server. Just click the
new download icon on the top bar when viewing a grain. You will get a zip file
containing the grain’s storage, which you can re-upload to the server (or to a
different server) later on.</p>

<h3 id="security-no-need-for-root">Security: No need for root</h3>

<p>Sandstorm can now be installed and run without root privileges or setuid
binaries. To accomplish this, we use Linux’s “UID namespaces” feature, which
essentially allows other sandboxing features to be accessed by an unprivileged user.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you are developing Sandstorm apps, it is still necessary to
install Sandstorm with root privileges because the dev tools rely on FUSE and
FUSE filesystems cannot currently be mounted inside UID namespaces. We hope the
Linux kernel will eventually add this feature.</p>

<p>Due to the use of UID namespaces, Sandstorm now requires Linux kernel version
3.13 or better. The installer will verify that you are ready to run Sandstorm.</p>

<p>Thanks to Andy for contributing much of the work on this.</p>

<h3 id="seccomp-bpf-sandboxing">Seccomp-BPF Sandboxing</h3>

<p>We’ve now enabled a basic seccomp filter to disable some dangerous system calls.
Seccomp is a Linux feature that makes sandboxing more secure by disabling system
calls (OS features) that apps don’t need. A typical web server uses only a tiny
fraction of Linux’s system calls. By disabling the rest, we make sure that if a
kernel exploit is found in one of them, it won’t allow an app to escape its
sandbox.</p>

<p>For now, we’ve disabled a few calls that provide complicated functionality that
has been the subjects of vulnerabilities in the past, and that no web server
rightly needs. We plan to expand on this in the future, eventually implementing
a small whitelist and probably moving many system calls to userspace. All of
this will be totally transparent to apps.</p>

<p>Again, thanks to Andy for getting this started.</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2014-06-04-self-service-web-publishing">Host Your Web Site</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/kentonv">Kenton Varda</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2014-06-04-self-service-web-publishing">04 Jun 2014</a>
  <p>Sandstorm now supports apps that publish content to your personal web domain,
such as blogging apps and content management systems.</p>

<p>While we already had an app that claimed to do this (the “Hacker CMS” app), it
previously required manual configuration of nginx to actually serve the content.
Users of alpha.sandstorm.io actually had to ask me to manually set things up.
But as of build 0.20, you can host your site in a completely self-service way.</p>

<p>To try it out, install the latest version of Hacker CMS from the
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/apps">app list</a> and click the “Setup DNS” button. (If you
already have the app installed, install it again to get the latest version;
we’re still working on automatic updates.)</p>

<p>Hacker CMS is still mostly a tech demo, and we’d like to replace it with ports
of some better-known blogging platforms. That said, our own blog at
blog.sandstorm.io is actually hosted using Hacker CMS.</p>

<p>Want to write your own app that does web publishing? Check out
<a href="https://github.com/kentonv/sandstorm/wiki/Publishing-to-the-user's-domain">the wiki page</a>
to see how.</p>

<h3 id="tool-improvements">Tool Improvements</h3>

<p>We’ve been hard at work improving Sandstorm’s developer experience. Some
highlights include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your app’s stdout/stderr output is now accessible via the web UI. Just click
the wrench icon.</li>
  <li>A file size indicator is now shown in the top bar, so you can see if your app
is using unreasonable disk space (<em>cough</em> MongoDB <em>cough</em>).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jparyani">Jason Paryani</a> has built preliminary support
for e-mail, which he’ll talk more about in a future update (once an app is ready).</li>
  <li>Many other small tweaks have been made to the <code>spk</code> tool.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="all-invites-sent">All Invites Sent</h3>

<p>Everyone who was on the <a href="https://sandstorm.io/#signup-form">mailing list</a>
as of yesterday should have received an invite to alpha.sandstorm.io by now. Please
let me know if you are on the list but didn’t receive one. Sorry it took so long!
We will continue sending invites to new sign-ups as long as we can handle the
server load.</p>

<h3 id="follow-sandstorm-on-twitter-and-google">Follow Sandstorm on Twitter and Google+!</h3>

<p>We are <a href="http://twitter.com/SandstormIO">@SandstormIO on Twitter</a>

  <h2><a href="/news/2014-05-12-easy-port">Easy-Port</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/kentonv">Kenton Varda</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2014-05-12-easy-port">12 May 2014</a>
  <h3 id="port-your-app-to-sandstorm-in-five-minutes">Port your app to Sandstorm in five minutes!</h3>

<p>Sandstorm employs a native-code sandbox. App servers may be written using any
technology stack that runs on Linux. The app provides all of its own libraries;
all Sandstorm provides is a filesystem and HTTP routing.</p>

<p>Up until now, porting apps to Sandstorm was a rather tedious process involving
carefully figuring out dependencies and building a chroot environment. But now,
we’ve written a tool that automates the process. It’s so easy that if you have
a traditional web app server already running on your Linux machine, you can
probably turn it into a Sandstorm app package in five minutes or less.</p>

<p>The trick is actually quite simple: we run your app in a special version of
the Sandstorm sandbox running on top of a FUSE filesystem that detects exactly
what files your app tries to open, satisfies those dependencies just-in-time,
and then makes a list so that you can build a package later. By default, the
tool just pulls binaries and libraries from your local system. Just make sure
to test all of your app’s features in dev mode, and you should have a complete
package.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kentonv/sandstorm/wiki/Porting-Guide">Check out the porting guide for details.</a></p>

<h3 id="wait-what-about-reproducible-builds">Wait, what about reproducible builds?</h3>

<p>Glad you asked. Obviously, pulling whatever happens to be installed on your own
machine into a package is a huge hack. A serious project will probably want to
do something more hermetic and reproducible. Sandstorm supports that just fine.
You can configure excatly where the dev tool looks for dependencies; it doesn’t
have to be your own root directory. So, set up a chroot environment in whatever
way suits you, and point it at that.</p>

<p>You could, for example, use <a href="https://docker.io">Docker</a>. Once you’ve set up an
appropriate Docker container for your app, point the Sandstorm dev tool at it
and build a package. But it’s also possible to use the package management
systems of various Linux distros directly. We didn’t want to constrain you to
any one toolchain, because we know everyone has different tastes.</p>

<h3 id="speaking-of-docker">Speaking of Docker</h3>

<p>Many people have asked how Sandstorm is different from Docker. The answer is in
the user interface. Docker is essentially a set of command-line tools for
building chroot environments and deploying them. It is meant to be used by
developers and sysadmins, to deploy software that might have any arbitrary
number of users or, indeed, not be user-oriented at all. Docker is awesome at
what it does, but what it does is actually not at all the same thing as what
Sandstorm does.</p>

<p>In contrast, Sandstorm is a user interface for a personal cloud server. It is
perfectly possible for a non-technical end user to install new apps to their
Sandstorm instance and use them. Moreover, Sandstorm provides and integrated
login and sharing model, so that individual apps do not have to implement this
themselves. The Sandstorm platform sits between the user and the app, so when
an HTTP request arrives at the app, it is already annotated with information about the
user’s identity and permissions as authenticated by the platform. Eventually, Sandstorm aims to provide a user
interface that allows end users to connect their apps to each other and to
other users’ app securely through an intuitive UI – think OAuth, except
streamlined because all the apps already share an authentication system.
Meanwhile, until two app instances have been connected by the user, they are
completely isolated from each other, so that you need not worry that one
insecure app might compromise your whole server.</p>
