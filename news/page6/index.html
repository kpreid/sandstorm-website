  <h2><a href="/news/2016-08-03-whats-new">July changelog - what's new in Sandstorm</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-08-03-whats-new">03 Aug 2016</a>
  <p>In July, we introduced a new Sandstorm feature: Apps can notify users when something interesting
happens within a grain. For example, Etherpad uses this to tell you when someone leaves a comment on
a document. This ActivityEvent API was designed by Kenton Varda and its visual elements were
designed by Néna Nguyễn. You can read more in its <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/blob/master/src/sandstorm/activity.capnp">Cap’n Proto
definition</a>; any
app within Sandstorm can use it. The easiest way to try it out is to make a new Etherpad document,
then open it in an incognito window, and use the incognito window to leave yourself a comment.</p>

<p>This change, and many more, went live during July. To keep your Sandstorm server updated, you can
sit back and relax. In the default configuration, Sandstorm’s automatic updates will install updates
within 24 hours of a new release.</p>

<p>Here’s the full July changelog!</p>

<h3 id="v0173-2016-07-23">v0.173 (2016-07-23)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sandstorm for Work: Added server whitelabeling features. Find under “Personalization” in the admin panel.</li>
  <li>Apps now receive profile pictures for all users. Users who have no picture get an identicon. Previously, apps were expected to generate identicons themselves.</li>
  <li>HTTP requests to / responses from apps now pass through any header prefixed with <code>X-Sandstorm-App-</code>. Also, <code>X-OC-Mtime</code> is whitelisted in responses, to improve Davros’ compatibility with ownCloud clients.</li>
  <li>Attempting to download a backup of a collection will show a warning explaining that this doesn’t do what you expect.</li>
  <li>Prevented guests from uploading grain backups. These uploads weren’t creating actual grains, but could use up server-side disk space.</li>
  <li>Fix bug in grainlist deduplification on app details page.</li>
  <li>Fixed that the admin page for managing a specific user only showed their login identities, not non-login identities. The main list showed both, but the non-login identities would disappear when clicking through to a specific user.</li>
  <li>The favicon is now transparent instead of white-background.</li>
  <li>The guided tour highlight of the “share access” button no longer blacks out the button on Firefox.</li>
  <li>The admin UI’s “Personalization” page no longer fails to save if you haven’t entered a Terms of Service or Privacy Policy URL.</li>
  <li>“204 No Content” responses from apps now preserve the ETag.</li>
  <li>Refactored powerbox client-side code to make it more pluggable.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v0172-2016-07-15-bugfixes">v0.172 (2016-07-15) [bugfixes]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a regression that caused accepting an app update notification to have no effect. Sandstorm will re-notify about missed updates within 24 hours.</li>
  <li>Fixed bugs preventing Sandstorm from working on IE10.</li>
  <li>Tweaked new activity event API.</li>
  <li>Major refactor of powerbox-related code.</li>
  <li>Bugfixes related to upcoming collections app.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v0171-2016-07-09">v0.171 (2016-07-09)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Activity/Notifications API:</strong> Apps can now inform Sandstorm when a grain has been modified. Sandstorm will then highlight the grain in the user interface to show that it has new content, and in some cases deliver notifications to interested users. Apps need to be updated to use the API, but an update to Etherpad will ship on Sunday with updates to Rocket.Chat and Wekan soon thereafter.</li>
  <li>Fixed regression where grain UIs would not refresh when the grain’s package was updated.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where it was possible to have a “shared with me” copy of a grain you own show up in your grain list, which in turn caused other bugs.</li>
  <li>Fixed spurious deprecation warning in server logs and reduced the size of the Sandstorm bundle by 10% by eliminating redundant copies of the Connect framework which were being included due to npm dependency semantics.</li>
  <li>Fixed some modal dialogs stretching off the screen on mobile.</li>
  <li>Various code refactoring.</li>
  <li>Oasis: Fixed that save()ing a capability was producing a SturdyRef that could not be restored due to bookkeeping errors.</li>
  <li>Sandstorm for Work: The SAML XML blob is now available even if the SAML identity provider has not yet been enabled. This should make setup easier.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v0170-2016-07-02-bugfixes">v0.170 (2016-07-02) [bugfixes]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Meteor-based apps will no longer go into redirect loops when WebSockets are not working.</li>
  <li>Sandstorm for Work: Fixed SAML login failing when a user’s name contained non-ASCII characters.</li>
  <li>The Powerbox API has changed slightly to involve a server-side exchange after the client-side selection operation. This improve security. Existing powerbox-using apps will need to be updated – but no major apps are using it yet.</li>
  <li>When using email login and clicking the link (rather than copy/pasting the token), you will now be redirected back to the URL from which you initiated login.</li>
  <li>Improved design of profile editor UI.</li>
  <li>The user table in the admin panel can now be sorted by clicking column headers.</li>
  <li>Fixed “guided tour” hint bubble for installing apps showing for users who aren’t allowed to install apps.</li>
</ul>

  <h2><a href="/news/2016-07-13-whats-new">June changelog - what's new in Sandstorm</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-07-13-whats-new">13 Jul 2016</a>
  <p>June’s big change is that we’ve reworked what first-time users see when using Sandstorm. There are
speech bubbles guiding them to install an app, create a grain, and to take a look at the “Share
access” interface, all powered by <a href="http://introjs.com/">intro.js</a>. I’m hopeful this helps people
become productive and comfortable with Sandstorm faster than before.</p>

<p>It applies to all users, including demo users, so test it out by opening
<a href="https://demo.sandstorm.io/">demo.sandstorm.io</a> in an incognito window and click Try a quick demo.</p>

<p>Some readers will appreciate that this month, we also chased down a subtle memory leak caused by a
lack of flow control in the HTTP implementation spread across proxy.js and
sandstorm-http-bridge. You’ll find the details in <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/pull/2056/files">pull request
#2056.</a></p>

<p>Read the full changelog here, or visit your own Sandstorm server’s “About Sandstorm” section for a
changelog at any time.</p>

<h3 id="v0169-2016-06-26-bugfixes">v0.169 (2016-06-26) [bugfixes]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed regression in static web publishing that caused requests that should have returned 404s or redirect-to-add-trailing-slash to instead return a 500 status with a blank page.</li>
  <li>Added ability for admin to request a heapdump (to debug memory leaks).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v0168-2016-06-24-bugfixes">v0.168 (2016-06-24) [bugfixes]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sandstorm for Work: SAML connector should now work with Active Directory.</li>
  <li>Fixed various subtle resource leaks in Sandstorm front-end and sandstorm-http-bridge.</li>
  <li>Fixed random crash/hang bug introduced in sandstorm-http-bridge v0.166. Apps build since that time will need to be rebuilt.</li>
  <li>The old admin interface has been completely removed (the new admin interface has been the default since v0.164).</li>
  <li>The email configuration test dialog now shows more informative error messages.</li>
  <li>The “most-used” apps row is now only shown if you have more than 6 apps, without which it isn’t helping.</li>
  <li>Added “guided tour” hint highlighting the “share access” button.</li>
  <li>Added explanatory text to admin user invite page.</li>
  <li>Fixed search bar autofocus on app list page.</li>
  <li>The question mark info button on Grains page was supposed to have a circle around it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v0167-2016-06-18-bugfixes">v0.167 (2016-06-18) [bugfixes]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Updated to Meteor 1.3.3.1.</li>
  <li>Implemented hard flow control at the Cap’n Proto layer so that an errant (or malicious) app cannot cause excessive memory use elsewhere in the system by making excessive simultaneous calls. This should improve the stability of Oasis.</li>
  <li>Implemented flow control for uploads to an app (though it rarely comes into play unless running Sandstorm locally).</li>
  <li>Fixed that after losing internet connectivity for a while (or suspending your laptop) and then coming back, grains would refresh.</li>
  <li>Fixed some memory leaks in shell server.</li>
  <li>Added more “guided tour” points to help new users learn Sandstorm.</li>
  <li>Sandstorm for Work: SAML connector now exports XML auto-configuration blob.</li>
  <li>Sandstorm for Work: Improved UI around feature keys.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v0166-2016-06-11-bugfixes">v0.166 (2016-06-11) [bugfixes]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented flow control for large file downloads from apps so that they don’t buffer in the front-end consuming excessive RAM. Apps that handle large files will need to re-pack using the latest sandstorm-http-bridge and push an update.</li>
  <li>Sandstorm for Work: Made SAML entity ID configurable; added more setup instructions.</li>
  <li>Updated Google login setup instructions to match latest gratuitous UI changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v0165-2016-06-04-bugfixes">v0.165 (2016-06-04) [bugfixes]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Re-enabled websocket self-check under new admin UI.</li>

  <h2><a href="/news/2016-06-29-asheesh-web-apps">Upcoming Event: Web app packaging in Sandstorm: It's not LAMP</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/neynah">Nena Nguyen</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-06-29-asheesh-web-apps">29 Jun 2016</a>
  <p>On July 19th, Sandstorm core dev <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Larioa</a> will be giving a talk about web packaging at our South Bay Sandstorm meetup.</p>

<p><img src="/news/images/asheesh-profile.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>Talk details</strong></p>

<p>This talk covers how web app packaging works for Sandstorm.io. Asheesh will compare and contrast Sandstorm packaging against the typical install process on a Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP system. This talk was featured at <a href="https://debconf16.debconf.org/talks/84/">Debconf16</a>, the yearly Debian conference.</p>

<p>He will outline how Sandstorm’s packaging tools do a few strange things to allow unprivileged users to install apps with one click:</p>

<p>• Every app package is a tiny Debian derivative, often as small as 20MB.</p>

<p>• Apps have no Internet connectivity to the outside world.</p>

<p>• Sandstorm uses a FUSE filesystem to identify which files are needed to run the app.</p>

<p>• An app bundles all its needed services, as well as files, resulting in one MySQL service per app.</p>

<p>• Users click and run one instance of an app like Etherpad per document, which is all handled transparently via a web app, a strategy that has neutralized 95% of 0-day web app vulnerabilities, based on our analysis.</p>

<p>• Developers on Mac OS and Windows can create packages for Sandstorm, even though Sandstorm is Linux-only, due to an emphasis on Linux VMs in our development tools.</p>

<p>Somehow we manage to make this scale reasonably well. Additionally, it is popular with upstream authors: of the &gt;58 web apps packaged for Sandstorm, about 1/3 are maintained by their upstreams.</p>

<p>This talk focuses on how the Sandstorm packaging tools work, with community insights as well as technical ones, with the hopes of showing Debian how to more effectively package web apps for end users.</p>

<p>Come for the opportunity to meet others in the Sandstorm community, and work on your project with guidance from our core devs. This event will be held at RethinkDB in Mountain View on July 19. RSVP <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/events/231954146/">here</a>.</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2016-06-20-drew-object-capabilities">Designing secure systems with Object-Capabilities, Python, and Cap'n Proto</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/neynah">Nena Nguyen</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-06-20-drew-object-capabilities">20 Jun 2016</a>
  <p>At our Sandstorm meetup on June 16th, Sandstorm core dev <a href="https://github.com/zarvox">Drew Fisher</a> talked about an object-oriented programming inspired technique for designing secure systems called object-capability security.</p>

<p>Object-capability security is a technique for designing systems that lets us apply object-oriented design principles to security policies, reducing cognitive overhead and risk of errors that lead to vulnerabilities. In this talk, Drew explains capabilities, how they work, and what cool things they make possible for your systems, with real-world examples from Sandstorm.io.</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2016-06-13-photo-library-lychee">How to create a shared photo library with Lychee</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/ovizii">Ovidiu Pacuraru</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-06-13-photo-library-lychee">13 Jun 2016</a>
  <p><em>Today’s blog post comes from guest writer Ovidiu Pacuraru.</em></p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will show you how a family on holiday can organize images from dad’s DSLR, mom’s iPhone and the kid’s Android phone inside one album. They can all use the same Lychee grain in Sandstorm from a web browser; this tutorial shows how to set it up.</p>

<p><img src="/news/images/lychee-9.png" /></p>

<p>There are at least a couple of different scenarios where you’d want to create a photo library and share it with others. Another example is when 3 people are writing a blog but only one editor approves images, so images need to be collected at a central point. I have found uploading and sharing via Google to be a bit hit and miss.</p>

<p>In any case where you need to create a shared photo library using Lychee, you can follow these steps:</p>

<h3>1. Get Sandstorm by <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io/">signing up for Oasis</a> or <a href="https://sandstorm.io/get">installing it on your own machine.</a><h3>

<h3>2. Install Lychee from the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io">App Market</a></h3>
<img src="/news/images/lychee-1.png" />

<h3>3. In the next window that opens, click: INSTALL</h3> 
<img src="/news/images/lychee-2.png" />

<h3>4. Create a new grain</h3>
<img src="/news/images/lychee-3.png" />

<h3>5. Rename your grain</h3>
<img src="/news/images/lychee-4.png" />

<h3>6. Add an album</h3>
<img src="/news/images/lychee-5.png" />

<h3>7. Name your album</h3>
<img src="/news/images/lychee-6.png" />

<h3>8. Upload some images</h3>
<img src="/news/images/lychee-7.png" />
<img src="/news/images/lychee-8.png" />

<h3>9. Browse your album</h3>
<img src="/news/images/lychee-9.png" />

<h3>10. Share access with your family</h3>
<img src="/news/images/lychee-10.png" />

<h3>11. Invite family members</h3>
<img src="/news/images/lychee-11.png" />

<p>
I hope you enjoy creating photo albums using <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/z6rj6js4h8p8rjz2myp3dwmv3mcfv40qyfdn0d7714qxzvzvq3w0">Lychee from the Sandstorm App Market</a>. Don't forget to leave a review!
