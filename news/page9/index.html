  <h2><a href="/news/2016-02-03-hn-highlights">Sandstorm user stories from Hacker News</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/jadeqwang">Jade Wang</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-02-03-hn-highlights">03 Feb 2016</a>
  <p>While <a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2016-01-22-8-new-open-source-apps">my previous blog post</a> was discussed on Hacker News yesterday, <em>andybak</em> asked to “hear from people that are using Sandstorm day to day.” <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11023300">Reading the replies</a> really made me appreciate the warmth of the <a href="https://sandstorm.io/community">Sandstorm community</a>, and I just wanted to share a few excerpts.</p>

<p>Nolan Darilek writes:</p>

<blockquote class="notbig">
  <p>I use Sandstorm daily. Private/company projects are run in <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/zx9d3pt0fjh4uqrprjftgpqfwgzp6y2ena6098ug3ctv37uv6kfh">Gitlab</a> instances, though I may switch to <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/6va4cjamc21j0znf5h5rrgnv0rpyvh1vaxurkrgknefvj0x63ash">Gitweb</a> if a minor cosmetic issue is resolved  (Gitweb in Sandstorm can only host one repo by design but you still have to click through to it when viewing the instance, which is mildly annoying when all other apps come up ready to use.)</p>

  <p>I have a bunch of <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h">Wekan</a> boards managing everything from coding projects to my GTD buckets to separate boards for random home improvement projects. I prefer Wekan to spreadsheets because I can track work through arbitrary workflows and annotate items with additional data, and Sandstorm lets me manage that without having to maintain and secure a separate Wekan server that any random person could find and exploit. My blog is hosted in <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/aax9j672p6z8n7nyupzvj2nmumeqd4upa0f7mgu8gprwmy53x04h">Sandstorm WordPress</a> so I have the niceness of its admin interface but none of its security risks, and all the speed of a static site. A small 2-person bootstrapped startup I’ve cofounded uses it for many of the same use cases plus hosting our app’s <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/xuajusd5d4a9v4js71ru0cwj9wn984q1x8kny10htsp8f5dcfep0">Piwik</a> instance, again so there’s literally no non-Sandstorm-secured user-facing attack surface other than Piwik’s API endpoint. I have an idea for a platform co-op in the middle distant future, and if I manage to launch it then I’ll run it via Sandstorm-hosted Loomio, which I’m actively attempting to port and am fairly close to completing.</p>

  <p>Sandstorm is a great platform, and the community comprises some of the nicest, most dedicated folks I know. When my cofounder messed up our install a bit, Kenton talked us through fixing it on a weekend no less, right down to giving us database queries to run and then patching Sandstorm to handle our edge case the next week. Awesome people.</p>

My blog is hosted on Sandstorm, but I’ve posted to it like four times so it doesn’t really count.</p>

  <p>I’ve been hosting a <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/wfg1r0qra2ewyvns05r0rddqttt57qxurz3nz5z95rjnm63et7e0">Groove Basin</a> instance on it for the last little while. Check it out, it’s anarchist radio! <a href="https://mrdomino.sandcats.io/shared/_NnFzbFzvci0JBgXw3hRwCWOHeECQkJEIO00t2zUmXX">Link »</a></p>

  <p>At some point some crazy mofo is going to post it to hackernews. Hopefully I don’t have to revoke the URL and clean up any spam and y’all just groove with the little community I’ve got going on there! But just in case, here’s one where you can only listen, that might last a little longer: <a href="https://mrdomino.sandcats.io/shared/kYJ-X75DzV3HTB0Ro6cTizCDhUUSyFd3xnNczrxKXbZ">Link »</a></p>

  <p>I posted a URL for that station to my work’s Slack, and then people started uploading stuff and rocking out. We’ve had a great time taking turns DJing, sharing our musical taste with each other, and hijacking the stream when it gets too boring or weird. I’ve had friends of mine jump on from elsewhere in the world, some who I haven’t seen in years, and drop their music on us. We’re completely in love with this – it’s a way for us to stay connected through music without disturbing the people who just want to work quietly.</p>

  <p>I’m astounded at how easy Sandstorm made this whole thing. These guys continue to blow me away with their ability to create incredibly useful experiences on a small budget and in such a short time.</p>

<p>Are you using Sandstorm at work? Drop me a line at <a href="mailto:community@sandstorm.io">community@sandstorm.io</a>, I’d love to hear about it and find out how I can be useful!</p>

  <p>Have an <a href="http://oasis.sandstorm.io">Oasis account</a> already? If not, you can <a href="https://sandstorm.io/get">sign up for one right now</a> and start using it to install any of the 48 apps in the <a href="http://apps.sandstorm.io">Sandstorm App Market</a>.

<p>I also wanted to share with you an article I wrote for OpenSource.com, highlighting the <a href="https://opensource.com/life/15/12/5-open-source-web-apps-self-hosted">open source apps on Sandstorm that replace Google Drive</a>.</p>

<p>Check out these apps and more in the <a href="http://apps.sandstorm.io">Sandstorm App Market</a>. Or write your own round-up blog post of your own favorite apps and drop a line to <a href="mailto:community@sandstorm.io">community@sandstorm.io</a> to let me know.</p>

<h2 id="spread-the-love">Spread the love</h2>

<p>Did you know that you can get bonus storage on Oasis through the <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io/referrals">referral program</a>?</p>

<p>Unlock up to 30GB if you’re a paid user, or up to 2GB bonus storage (+ unlimited grains) for free tier users. (Technically, all plans are free right now while we’re in beta, so catch that while you can.)  That bonus storage will come in handy when you switch over to <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/8aspz4sfjnp8u89000mh2v1xrdyx97ytn8hq71mdzv4p4d8n0n3h">Davros</a> like me.</p>

  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/kentonv">Kenton Varda</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-01-20-how-it-works">20 Jan 2016</a>
  <p style="text-align: center"><a href="/how-it-works"><img src="/images/how-it-works.png" /></a></p>

<p>Last week <a href="/news/2016-01-11-website">we announced the launch of our new web site</a>. Everything has changed!</p>

<p>Today, I want to call your attention to one page that I’m particularly excited to have written: <a href="/how-it-works">The “How it works” page</a>. Sandstorm is radically different from all other web infrastructure you might be familiar with, in that we containerize not just “microservices” but individual documents. As it turns out, this has all kinds of huge advantages, especially in terms of security but also in the ability to compose apps into larger workflows. Read all about it here:</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2016-01-11-website">The new Sandstorm.io website</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-01-11-website">11 Jan 2016</a>
  <p>If you take a look at <a href="https://sandstorm.io/">https://sandstorm.io/</a>, you’ll see our new website, created by Néna Nguyen with assistance from Kenton Varda. They took feedback from many users and the core dev team over the course of building it, and we’re all going to keep adjusting it over time. If you have feedback, please share it with the community in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sandstorm-dev">sandstorm-dev mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted to highlight a few important things the new website does better when compared to the old website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213145657/https://sandstorm.io/">available at the Internet Archive</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Responsive design.</strong> If you view the new website on a phone, you’ll get something reasonable. This wasn’t true a year ago, and it required some thinking. If you’re new to responsive web design, start by reading <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">Ethan Marcotte’s article at A List Apart</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Flexbox.</strong> We use the new <code>display: flex;</code> layout mode so that we can express columns very naturally in CSS. So far we’re very happy with it. You can read up about it at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes">MDN</a> or by playing <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a>, an interactive learning game. You can also read our CSS on the <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm-website">GitHub repository for the website</a> to find out how we use it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SCSS/SASS.</strong> We now use a CSS extension language called <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a>. This lets us use features like variables and nesting. You can see how we use it in the <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm-website">sandstorm-website GitHub repository</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Multiple pages.</strong> The older Sandstorm.io website had just one page: index.html. The new site goes into more depth about <a href="https://sandstorm.io/how-it-works">how Sandstorm works</a>, how to <a href="https://sandstorm.io/community">get involved in the community</a>. how <a href="https://sandstorm.io/business">businesses can make the best use of Sandstorm</a>, and more. It was time to have more than one page. A side note: if you hear us talking about how the “front page redesign” is finally done, this is because we’re used to the entire website being one page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A button to sign in to Oasis, our hosting service.</strong> Sandstorm is open source software that anyone can install; since not everyone wants to install it, <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io/">oasis.sandstorm.io</a> is our hosting service where you can run Sandstorm apps without your own server. The new “sign-in” link above the fold makes it easy to log into our Oasis hosting service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>One repository for the blog and the website.</strong> Until now, we maintained the Sandstorm blog separately, with its own templates and no version control. Kenton built the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/nqmcqs9spcdpmqyuxemf0tsgwn8awfvswc58wgk375g4u25xv6yh">Hacker CMS</a> app for this purpose. Now that the main website uses Jekyll, we’ve integrated our old blog posts into the main <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm-website">sandstorm-website</a> git repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A simpler top banner.</strong> In the previous website, the banner at the top of the site would allow you to subscribe to our Facebook page, or try a demo, or download Sandstorm, or sign up now for the Oasis hosting service. We’ve limited the number of options to help people learn more faster.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the most essential changes. You’ll find a lot of subtle changes as you click around <a href="https://sandstorm.io/">the new site</a> and compare it to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213145657/https://sandstorm.io/">the old one!</a> If you have comments, consider <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm-website/issues">filing a bug</a> or emailing <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sandstorm-dev">sandstorm-dev</a>. Kudos to Néna Nguyen and Kenton Varda for getting these changes ready in record time.</p>
