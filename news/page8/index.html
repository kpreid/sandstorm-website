  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-05-06-university-it-be-the-hero">06 May 2016</a>
  <p>Picture yourself running a university IT helpdesk. When professors come to you, you point to the
tech tools your colleagues have already deployed. It takes a long process to get something new
approved. You know that’s been limiting professors’ creativity, but you haven’t known what to do
about it.</p>

<p>Then one day, Sandstorm comes along.</p>

<p>Now educators are empowered to help themselves. They can make course websites with Ghost, teach
students how to typeset documents using ShareLaTeX, or create shared folders for classes using
Davros. They can even use GrooveBasin to set up a collaborative radio station for a music history
course.</p>

<p>All that happens on your Sandstorm server, running safely within the institution.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-help-spread-the-word">Can you help spread the word?</h3>

<p>Néna Nguyễn just finished designing a page with the
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/go/education">information educators need about Sandstorm</a>. I’m writing because
I need your help reaching educators and technologists to share it with.</p>

<p>Can you think of an IT staffer or professor who is wondering how to get access to a wider variety of
software available at their institution? If so, please send them a link to
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/go/education">https://sandstorm.io/go/education</a>. I just sent it to the head
of IT at my alma mater’s CS department.</p>

<p>If they ask you about security or privacy, you can tell them that Sandstorm is
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/install/">self-hostable</a> open source software, integrates with
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/business">LDAP/SAML single sign-on</a>, and
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2016-02-29-security-track-record">automatically mitigates 95% of security issues, before they are even discovered</a>.
For more on Sandstorm’s security design, read our
<a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/using/security-practices/">security practices documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/kentonv">Kenton Varda</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-04-06-sandstorm-for-work">06 Apr 2016</a>
  <p>Sandstorm is a great way to run open source collaborative productivity apps like document editors, task managers, chat rooms, file sharing, and more (54 apps and growing), all in one place. Lots of people – including us – use Sandstorm every day as part of doing their jobs. For example, right now I am composing this blog post in <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/fq057t4ek3yt96xsfje6c1wv61pkjkqm9hs1539x4jqxjwzdp7fh">Dillinger</a> running on <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io">Sandstorm Oasis</a> (our hosting service), but many people choose to self-host Sandstorm on their own machines.</p>

<p><img style="float: right; width: 283px; height: 221px;" src="/images/business-ldap.png" /></p>

<p><a href="https://sandstorm.io/business">Sandstorm for Work</a> makes self-hosted Sandstorm easier to integrate into a corporate environment. That means you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Integrate with LDAP (including Active Directory) or SAML for single-sign-on.</li>
  <li>Manage user groups and domains as whole units rather than inviting each user individually.</li>
  <li>Specify organization-wide access control policies, like “no sharing outside of the organization”.</li>
  <li><a href="https://sandstorm.io/business">And more…</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We’re in beta now, so not all features are ready yet, but once you’ve installed Sandstorm you’ll automatically receive updates as they become available.</p>

<p>To get started now, install Sandstorm and choose “Sandstorm for Work” during setup (or if you already have a server, look for the “for Work” tab in the admin settings). Sandstorm for Work is priced at $15/user/month, and currently we’re offering a 90-day free trial. (It’s still open source! More on that in a bit.)</p>

<p><a href="https://sandstorm.io/install" class="linkbutton">Install Sandstorm »</a></p>

<h3 id="productivity-apps-large-and-small">Productivity Apps Large and Small</h3>

<p>With Sandstorm for Work, you can run apps similar to popular SaaS products, but keep your data in-house. For example, you can run <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/h37dm17aa89yrd8zuqpdn36p6zntumtv08fjpu8a8zrte7q1cn60">Etherpad</a> and <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/a0n6hwm32zjsrzes8gnjg734dh6jwt7x83xdgytspe761pe2asw0">EtherCalc</a> instead of Google Docs, <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h">Wekan</a> instead of Trello, <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/vfnwptfn02ty21w715snyyczw0nqxkv3jvawcah10c6z7hj1hnu0">Rocket.Chat</a> instead of Slack, and <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/8aspz4sfjnp8u89000mh2v1xrdyx97ytn8hq71mdzv4p4d8n0n3h">Davros</a> instead of Dropbox. Once you have Sandstorm running, you can install each new app with a click – no need to create a new account on a new service, and no worry about whether that service is sufficiently private and secure. With Sandstorm, running apps in-house is actually <strong>easier</strong> than using SaaS.</p>

<p>But even more interestingly, you can run apps on Sandstorm that aren’t available anywhere else, like Simon Vansintjan’s <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/c6zfftftrra9d4pdyuc1psew65ukqrjujvk20fac4zke1uasxv10">Annotate</a>. The idea behind Annotate is simple: upload an image, then annotate it with comments. We at Sandstorm use it to discuss UI and illustration mockups. Here’s me using it to comment on a slide deck we’re working on:</p>

<p style="max-width: 500px; margin: 1em auto;"><a href="/news/images/annotate.png"><img src="/news/images/annotate-small.png" /></a></p>

<p>What I love about Annotate is its simplicity: Simon wrote the whole thing in a couple weekends. And yet, it’s enough to be useful to design teams anywhere. No matter what Simon decides to do in the future, this app will never disappear, and you don’t have to trust Simon because your data stays on your server.</p>

<p>Annotate is just one of <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io">54 apps and growing</a> on our app market. By installing Sandstorm at your workplace, you get access to all of these at once, under a single login, and without giving up control of your data.</p>

<h3 id="security-behind-the-firewall">Security Behind the Firewall</h3>

<p><img style="float: right; width: 236px; height: 188px;" src="https://sandstorm.io/images/why-finegrained.svg" /></p>

<p>Of course, if you want to run apps on your own infrastructure, behind your firewall, you need to think about security. A malicious app – or a buggy app that gets hacked – can compromise your whole network.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Sandstorm protects you. Sandstorm is the only container engine that implements <a href="https://sandstorm.io/how-it-works">fine-grained isolation</a>, locking every document in its own container. By doing so, it prevents any app from compromising the server or network, and indeed <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/using/security-non-events/">it renders 95% of app security vulnerabilities moot before they are even discovered</a>.</p>

<h3 id="developing-for-enterprise">Developing for Enterprise</h3>

<p>Are you a developer of a web app aimed at enterprise? Do you ever get requests for an on-prem version, but find it hard to fulfill this request given the myriad environments and infrastructure you’d need to support? Perhaps we can help. If you target Sandstorm, then these logistics become our job. If your app works on one Sandstorm server, it will work everywhere. If you are interested in learning more, <a href="https://sandstorm.io/developer">check out our developer features</a> and <a href="mailto:community@sandstorm.io">e-mail us</a>.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-open-source">Is it Open Source?</h3>

<p>Yes! Sandstorm for Work features are part of the same codebase as the rest of Sandstorm and under the same Apache 2.0 license. However, in order to unlock Sandstorm for Work features, we ask that you buy a “feature key” from us.</p>

<p>So how does that work? Can’t anyone just remove the feature key check? In fact, yes, you can. However, if you did that, you would not be able to take advantage of our automatic updater, which ensures that your server is updated to the latest version within 24 hours of any release with no effort on your part. Automatic updates are important to keep your server secure and to make sure you can always run the latest apps.</p>

<p>Purchasing a feature key also entitles you to priority support. However, we don’t want to be a company who primarily sells support, because we think that creates a perverse incentive for us to make our product hard to use. Indeed, it is our goal that no one should ever need to contact support at all, but under a support model, we’d be putting ourselves out of business! Under the feature key model, we are selling features, and promising support if there are problems. This way, we are incentivized to make sure there are no problems, because then we don’t have to answer support tickets.</p>

<h3 id="the-future">The Future</h3>

<p>We like to release features early and often – we push a new release almost every week. What we are announcing today is only the beginning of what we have in store for Sandstorm for Work. Over the coming months, we’ll be adding features like group management (to make it easier to share documents with your team), audit logging (keep track of who has been accessing what, for security and compliance purposes), customizable access control policies, and much more.</p>

<p>If you install Sandstorm today, <strong>you’ll automatically get these features as they become available</strong> – your server will automatically update after every weekly release with no action needed on your part. So why not install now and see what you think? Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/issues">file a bug</a> to tell us what you want to see next.</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2016-02-29-security-track-record">Sandstorm's security track record, and what it means for self-hosting</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-02-29-security-track-record">29 Feb 2016</a>
  <p>Today I want to share the results of our own <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/using/security-non-events/">analysis of security issues of web apps available on
the Sandstorm app market</a>.</p>

<h3 id="95-of-security-issues-automatically-mitigated-before-they-were-discovered">95% of security issues automatically mitigated, before they were discovered</h3>

<p>Sandstorm automatically protects users from a huge fraction of the publicly disclosed security
vulnerabilities discovered in apps on the Sandstorm app market, before the vulnerabilities were even
disclosed. Of the issues we examined, 95% were wholly or partly mitigated. You can read the <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/using/security-non-events/">full
report here in our
documentation</a>. The analysis covers
publicly-disclosed vulnerabilities in Etherpad, WordPress, Roundcube, ShareLaTeX, and Tiny Tiny
RSS. In WordPress, we limited our analysis to security issues of severity score 6 or higher, due to
the large number of issues. We also mitigated 21 CVEs in the Linux kernel to prevent sandbox
breakout.</p>

<p>We built Sandstorm to create a <a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2014-07-21-open-source-web-apps-require-federated-hosting">viable ecosystem for indie and open source web
apps</a>. When
server apps are as safe to run as apps on a phone, people will feel free to choose whatever software
they like. Consider that some Sandstorm apps, like
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2016-02-25-giftr">Giftr</a>, are small and don’t have as many people
checking the code for bugs. Sandstorm protects you when you use those apps, too.</p>

<p>We know that security is risk-management, not binary. No software, Sandstorm included, will ever
protect all user data from all bugs in all programs. However, raising barriers to a successful
attack means fewer successful attacks will occur.</p>

<h3 id="self-hosted-apps-can-be-as-secure-as-a-centralized-web-app">Self-hosted apps can be as secure as a centralized web app</h3>

<p>With Sandstorm, you get an experience as easy to use as software-as-a-service, and you retain the
privacy benefits of self-hosting. One of our key security strategies is to isolate each grain
(typically, one document) separately, so that a buggy or malicious app has a hard time ruining your
day. That degree of isolation is enabled by our various <a href="https://sandstorm.io/how-it-works">security
practices</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/using/security-practices/">read the full
analysis</a>, prepared by myself and
Kenton Varda. <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sandstorm-dev">Let us know</a> what
you think!</p>

<h3 id="when-self-hosting-is-secure-users-are-free-to-choose">When self-hosting is secure, users are free to choose</h3>

<p>Security enables freedom of choice. If you use a Sandstorm server, you can choose productivity tools
that fit your needs, even if the server is maintained by someone else.</p>

enjoy any of these apps or upload your own.</p>

<p>Or you can run your own Sandstorm install. Over the past six months, we’ve integrated <a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2015-10-01-free-ssl-certificates">free SSL
certificates</a> and
<a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2015-09-24-is-curl-bash-insecure-pgp-verified-install">cryptographically-verified automatic
updates</a> into
self-hosted Sandstorm. As soon as someone installs Sandstorm for an organization, they can safely
allow colleagues to choose their own tools. If you install Sandstorm for yourself, you can use the
best indie web apps and let the platform handle security for you.  Get started on the <a href="https://sandstorm.io/install">Sandstorm

  <p>Giftr is one of the newest additions to our <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/">App Market</a>; it helps make coordinating gift exchanges less painful for you and other gifters involved. At our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/events/227595644/">Sandstorm San Francisco meetup</a> in January, app author Andrew Wansley shared his story of how his decision to create &amp; package his <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/tr3w5p7ajsf61nf2e6dkfv8tdjes0qsm5w6ew0frd4qwnacwur90">Giftr</a> app all started from a simple family tradition.</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2016-02-05-app-author-publicity-oasis">Free publicity for your indie web app, and free Oasis service for you</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2016-02-05-app-author-publicity-oasis">05 Feb 2016</a>
  <p>Every useful web app deserves users and publicity. Every author deserves an easy way to see their app the way their users see it on Sandstorm.</p>

<p>So here’s the deal: If you write an open source web app, and you package it for Sandstorm, I’ll help people discover your app and use it. You’ll also get credit toward one year of <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io"><strong>Oasis managed hosting</strong></a> so you can test your app on Sandstorm. The offer applies to anyone who successfully submits an app to the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io">Sandstorm App Market</a>, whether or not you’re the original author. It doesn’t have to be open source, though we do love open source. The Oasis hosting can be used for anything you like.</p>

<h3 id="a-sandstorm-package-allows-people-to-use-your-app-even-if-you-dont-maintain-a-public-service">A Sandstorm package allows people to use your app even if you don’t maintain a public service</h3>

<p>When I asked <a href="http://simon.vansintjan.net/">Simon Vansintjan</a> why he made a Sandstorm package of his <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/wupmzqk4872vgsye9t9x5dmrdw17mad97dk21jvcm2ph4jataze0">Quick Survey</a> app, he told me, “I have no interest in running a SaaS of every small app that I think would be a benefit [to other people].”</p>

<p>Simon wants to publish code, not commit to maintaining a service. Simon wrote Quick Survey so he could run one particular survey, as well as for the joy of learning Meteor.</p>

<p>By packaging his app for Sandstorm, he got multiple document support without writing any code. Simon said, “Once I understood that [multi-document] translated really well to how Sandstorm views apps / grains, I figured it made a lot of sense to port it to Sandstorm. I’m happy I ended up trying to port it, because it opened up how easy it would be to get other apps up and running with it.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/wupmzqk4872vgsye9t9x5dmrdw17mad97dk21jvcm2ph4jataze0"><img src="/news/images/2016-02-05-app-author-publicity-oasis/cbd94e8d81ed9bccaf19eb0228dbf451.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /></a></p>

<p>You can <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/wupmzqk4872vgsye9t9x5dmrdw17mad97dk21jvcm2ph4jataze0">try out Quick Survey with a click.</a> Your app could be that easy to spin up.</p>

<p>Quick Survey is a web app that isn’t a business, and Sandstorm is perfect for apps like that. For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/frigginglorious">Daniel Kraft</a> is nearly done packaging up his personal D&amp;D dice rolling app. What hobby apps have you made that others might enjoy?</p>

<h3 id="publicity-graphics-app-demo-outreach-and-more">Publicity: Graphics, app demo, outreach, and more</h3>

<p>When your app is on the Sandstorm app market, it’s naturally in front of people who use Sandstorm every day. Universities, corporations, non-profits, and self-hosting enthusiasts alike spend huge amounts of time in apps on Sandstorm.</p>

<p>Beyond that, every Sandstorm app is supported by the Sandstorm.io community team — Néna, Jade, and me.</p>

<p>Néna supports open source web app developers by <a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2015-11-10-icons-spks-for-everyone#graphics-for-everyone">providing graphics</a> for any app with a Sandstorm package. Here are some of the graphics she’s put together:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/news/images/2016-02-05-app-author-publicity-oasis/10-appdesigns.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /></p>

<p>All three of us spend every day thinking about how to get more people using the apps in the Sandstorm ecosystem. The apps are what what make Sandstorm interesting. So we do things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Give every app a free, live demo service. This one goes to Hacker Slides. It could go to your app. <a href="https://demo.sandstorm.io/appdemo/7qvcjh7gk0rzdx1s3c8gufd288sesf6vvdt297756xcv4q8xxvhh"><img alt="Try Hacker Slides on Sandstorm" src="/news/images/2016-02-05-app-author-publicity-oasis/try-live%20demo-783189.svg" style="max-width: 92;" /></a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://opensource.com/life/14/8/sandstorm-open-source-web-apps">Write</a> <a href="https://opensource.com/life/16/1/8-ways-contribute-open-source-without-writing-code">articles</a> <a href="https://opensource.com/life/15/12/5-open-source-web-apps-self-hosted">for</a> outlets like opensource.com, reaching many thousands of readers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write about new apps in our <a href="https://sandstorm.io/#join-list">monthly newsletter</a>, seen by thousands of subscribers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Encourage Sandstorm community members to <a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2015-12-17-community-talks">give talks</a> about their favorite apps and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/topics/sandstorm/">organize meetups.</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write <a href="https://sandstorm.io/news/2016-01-22-8-new-open-source-apps">blog posts about new apps</a>, frequently seen on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11022993">Hacker News</a> (thanks to Andy for submitting the most recent one!).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find organizations that care about specific apps, and explain to them in person how the community’s apps plus self-hosting it would help the organization achieve its mission.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Sandstorm <a href="https://sandstorm.io/community">community</a> as a whole will give you feedback on your app if you email the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sandstorm-dev">sandstorm-dev group</a>. Check out these <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sandstorm-dev/YNiAzlqON40">recent</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sandstorm-dev/nVu9VBNFNUM">threads</a> to see how it works.</p>

<p>I want self-hosting to be a meaningful alternative to software as a service. You can be part of that movement by packaging your app for Sandstorm. If your app is written using Meteor, I’ll even create the <a href="one-click-installers-for-everyone">initial packaging</a>.</p>

<h3 id="see-what-users-see-with-a-free-power-user-account-on-oasis">See what users see, with a free Power User account on Oasis</h3>

<p>Your users probably don’t know how to deploy your app, which is why they need Sandstorm. I want you to be able to see what your users see, so I’ll give you <a href="https://sandstorm.io/get"><strong>a free year of Power User level on Oasis</strong></a> managed hosting if you write or package an app for Sandstorm.</p>

<p>While you’re on Oasis, feel free to enjoy it for anything else within the usual terms and conditions. Take advantage of private git repositories with <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/d9ygf47xrtnw12j92cyt6cu8ut75esx01u4q3kcrn8415w9qzzgh">gogs</a>, project task tracking with <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h">Wekan</a>, or privacy-preserving web analytics with <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/xuajusd5d4a9v4js71ru0cwj9wn984q1x8kny10htsp8f5dcfep0">Piwik</a>. I’ll also give you an invite to <a href="https://keybase.io">Keybase</a> so when people install your apps, they can verify your identity via the world’s most usable interface to PGP.</p>

<p>To take advantage of this offer, visit <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io/">Oasis</a> and upgrade to any paid plan, knowing that all the paid plans
are free-of-cost while Sandstorm is in beta. Then email me at community@sandstorm.io to request a statement credit equal to the cost of a Power User account. We’ll add it to your account, and you’ll be all set.</p>

<h3 id="to-get-started-read-the-docs-or-email-me">To get started, read the docs, or email me</h3>

<p>Every good web app deserves users and publicity. I’m here to help you with that.</p>

<p>You can dive right in by reading the <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/vagrant-spk/packaging-tutorial/">packaging tutorial</a>. Sandstorm supports any language/stack that runs on Linux, and has special <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/vagrant-spk/platform-stacks/">tooling</a> for nodejs, PHP/MySQL, Meteor, and Python.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure, or you just want to chat, or you’re waiting on us to publish your app, it’d be my honor to hear from you. Send me an email at <a href="mailto:community@sandstorm.io">community@sandstorm.io</a>!</p>
