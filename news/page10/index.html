  <h2><a href="/news/2015-12-18-referral-program">Sharing is referring - up to 30 GB bonus storage</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2015-12-18-referral-program">18 Dec 2015</a>
  <p>The easiest way to enjoy Sandstorm is on our <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io/">managed hosting</a>.
Now, when you invite your friends to the service, you’ll get up to 30 GB
of bonus storage as our way of saying thanks. When you share a grain with a
friend, and they make an account and start sharing, that’s a referral.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>

<p><strong>You share a grain</strong> with a friend (who isn’t already an Oasis user).</p>

<p><img style="margin: auto; max-width: 100%; display: block;" src="/news/images/share_access.png" /></p>

<p>Friend <strong>signs in.</strong></p>

<p><img style="margin: auto; max-width: 100%; display: block;" src="/news/images/referral-2.svg" /></p>

<p><strong>Friend shares a grain</strong> with any person (including you), who successfully opens the grain.</p>

<p><img style="margin: auto; max-width: 100%; display: block;" src="/news/images/share_access.png" /></p>

<h3 id="keeping-track-of-your-bonus">Keeping track of your bonus</h3>

<p>To see how you’re progressing, check out the referral program page in the
top-right drop-down menu.</p>

<p><img style="margin: auto; max-width: 100%; display: block;" src="/news/images/referral-program-menu.png" /></p>

<p>Or you can visit the <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io/referrals">referrals program page</a>
directly. Honestly, you should do that right now just to see
<a href="https://github.com/neynah">Néna Nguyễn’s</a> design work.</p>

<p>Paid subscribers can get up to 30 GB of free storage, in addition to the storage
from their account level, 2 GB per person they refer. Free account holders can
unlock unlimited grains and 50 MB of free storage per person they refer, up to 2 GB
total. If you need even more space, you can always upgrade your account.</p>

<h3 id="common-question-i-received-referral-bonus-storage-for-someone-i-dont-know-how-does-that-happen">Common question: I received referral bonus storage for someone I don’t know. How does that happen?</h3>

<p>Anyone who signs up for an Oasis account after opening up a grain that you shared
counts as your referral. If you tweeted a link or shared a document on a mailing
list (e.g., puzzle hunt team, collaborators at work, study group), anyone who
found Oasis through you and signs up for an account counts as your referral.</p>

<h3 id="get-started">Get started</h3>

<p>That’s it! To get started, open any grain and click Share Access in the top bar.</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2015-11-12-authenticated-app-packages">Authenticated app packages on Sandstorm with PGP and Keybase</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/zarvox">Drew Fisher</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2015-11-12-authenticated-app-packages">12 Nov 2015</a>
  <p>I like to joke that Sandstorm is a security project posing as a
usability project.  In actuality, it’s both!  Sandstorm users deserve to be
confident that the apps they’re running are exactly as
the packager built them, and have not been backdoored or accidentally modified
by a malicious ISP, government, or other attacker.  Furthermore, this
information must be easy to consume and verify.</p>

<p>To that end, I’ve worked with Kenton to make it possible to provide a cryptographic chain of trust
that connects the app package you’re installing to the app publisher’s online
accounts.  When you install the
<a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/a0n6hwm32zjsrzes8gnjg734dh6jwt7x83xdgytspe761pe2asw0">EtherCalc spreadsheet app</a>,
Sandstorm lets you see that the app was made by the same Audrey Tang that owns
<a href="https://github.com/audreyt">audreyt on Github</a> and
<a href="https://keybase.io/au">au on Keybase</a>.
Publisher information is shown front and center:</p>

<p><img src="/news/images/install-ethercalc.png" width="100%" alt="Installing EtherCalc" /></p>

<p>To make this all work, there are a few steps involved.</p>

<h3 id="the-app-id-is-a-public-key">The app ID is a public key</h3>

<p>Sandstorm has required that apps be signed since its inception, providing
a first line of defense against package corruption.  The app is signed with an
app-specific Ed25519 key at package-building time.  Sandstorm uses the public key
as the app’s ID on the app market and your server.</p>

<p>This guarantees that app packages cannot be modified by a CDN or the app market
without using a different app ID.  This also had the nice effect of providing
trust-on-first-use properties for apps until we were able to bind these
identities to something more meaningful.  The upshot: when you’ve installed an
app, only the same app author can provide updates to it.</p>

<h3 id="connect-the-app-id-to-a-pgp-key">Connect the app ID to a PGP key</h3>

<p>Since the release of the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/">app market</a>,
app packagers have been PGP-signing statements that they are the author of the
Sandstorm app with that app ID, and include that statement, their PGP public 
key, and the email address associated with that key in their package’s metadata.
Since that metadata is in the Sandstorm package file signed by the Ed25519 key,
any server running Sandstorm can verify
that these statements were provided by the person or people who control that
Ed25519 key.  Additionally, since the statement is signed by the PGP key, there
is a trust path from the owner of that PGP private key to the app you are
installing. To defeat this, an attacker would need to convince an app author to
replace both their signing statement and their PGP key in the package metadata
with ones produced by the attacker.</p>

<h3 id="connect-the-pgp-key-to-social-identities">Connect the PGP key to social identities</h3>

<p>The next goal is to connect that PGP fingerprint to meaningful, real-world
identities.  While a handful of people might be able to rely on the
web-of-trust to verify PGP fingerprints, most users will need something more
approachable.  That’s where <a href="https://keybase.io">Keybase</a> comes in.  Keybase
helps you link PGP keys to social identities, like GitHub or Twitter accounts.
App authors can create a Keybase account, then create signed proofs-of-ownership
that they post to their social media pages or websites.  Keybase provides an
index of these proofs, so given a PGP fingerprint, you can list the accounts for
which the PGP key’s owner has proven control.</p>

<h3 id="the-result-end-to-end-verified-apps">The result: end-to-end verified apps</h3>

<p>When you go to install a package, Sandstorm verifies that the package is
correctly signed by the Ed25519 key.  It looks for a PGP signature in the 
metadata, and verifies that the PGP-signed assertion is for the correct app ID 
and the email address specified in the metadata.  It queries the Keybase API to
see what accounts the packager has proven ownership of, and lists them with 
their links on the app install page.</p>

<p>Currently, the implementation of this feature trusts Keybase’s servers to verify
proofs and return an accurate list of the signer’s identities. However, Keybase
proofs are designed to be verifiable by third parties without trusting Keybase,
and we plan to extend Sandstorm to do this, thus eliminating Keybase itself from
the trust chain.</p>

<p>So that’s how Sandstorm links app packages to their
creators’ social identities, with cryptographic verification at each step along
the way, with no additional action needed by end users.  This is software
authenticity that Just Works, and it’s available today for all Sandstorm users
and packages in the App Market.  Today is a good day to

  <h2><a href="/news/2015-11-10-icons-spks-for-everyone">Graphics and one-click installers for everyone</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/jadeqwang">Jade Wang</a>
    
      and <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus">Asheesh Laroia</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2015-11-10-icons-spks-for-everyone">10 Nov 2015</a>
  <p>Open source web app developers build great apps. But sometimes, backend-minded developers need a little help, from making it easy for end users to install their apps to making their icons and other graphics visually appealing. To make open source web apps <a href="/news/2014-07-21-open-source-web-apps-require-federated-hosting.html">viable</a> as an ecosystem, the apps must be easy to install and use, and to get the attention they deserve, they should have good-looking icons that convey the purpose of the app.</p>

<h3 id="graphics-for-everyone">Graphics for everyone</h3>

<p>Lately, we’ve been running an experiment – will app authors be interested in custom graphics, designed by Néna Nguyen at Sandstorm? So far, <a href="https://github.com/audreyt/ethercalc/issues/236">the</a> <a href="https://github.com/cem/dillinger-sandstorm/pull/2">response</a> <a href="https://github.com/cem/nodebb-sandstorm/pull/1">has</a> <a href="https://github.com/jacksingleton/hacker-slides/issues/28">been</a> <a href="https://github.com/strawlab/neuron-catalog/pull/36">positive</a>!</p>

<p>So I’m excited to announce we’ll do this for everyone who packages their app
for Sandstorm: To support app authors, we are happy to help with graphics. This is on top of the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io/">one-click install</a> for your app that Sandstorm enables, which works just as well <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io">in the cloud</a> as it does for <a href="https://sandstorm.io/install">self-hosters</a> (see below). For instance, Néna will make an icon for you if you need it. Check out this awesome icon set that Néna made for Wekan (kanban board):</p>

<p>An app written <strong>using Meteor</strong> is the easiest to package – there’s a <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/vagrant-spk/packaging-tutorial-meteor">special tutorial for Meteor apps</a>. If you input the URL of your GitHub repo below, we can even do a first-run of the packaging for you and ping you with a live demo featuring your own spk (Sandstorm package):</p>
