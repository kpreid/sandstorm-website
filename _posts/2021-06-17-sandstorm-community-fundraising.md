Hey Everyone!

Members of the Sandstorm community are doing some fundraising!

Specifically,

- In the immediate term, we're [participating in FundOSS][1], a donation
  matching program that is a joint effort between [Open Source
  Collective][2] and [GitCoin][3] with a novel [democratic funding][4]
  model for allocating matching funds, designed to boost the impact of
  many small donations.
- Longer term, we're looking to promote an [OpenCollective community
  organization][5], as a basis to support Sandstorm's development financially.

The organizers are familiar faces, but we aren't and haven't ever been
formally affiliated with Sandstorm, Inc; we're just long-time community
members looking to chart a path for the Sandstorm project going forward.
We all miss the days when there were several people working on Sandstorm
full-time, and want to find ways to support continued development of
new features and additional app packaging efforts.

If you want to help us out here's how you can:

- [Make a donation][1] (even a small one) via FundOSS between now and June
  24th.
- If you want to support us in the long term, consider also making recurring
  donation to our [OpenCollective organization][5].
